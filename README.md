### Open source contribution:

### International Conferrence paper presented on topic "A Conclusive Approach To Analyze Web Reviews Through Maximal Phrase Based Technique" Umayam Publications, ISBN 81-903041-9-4.

Its a conclusive approach to analyze comments or reviews about a product/searched term from the web. In this paper we explore the use of phrases occurring maximally in text as properties for sentiment classification of product reviews. The approach does not rely on predefined sentiment lexicons, and the motivation for this is that potentially every word could be considered as expressing something positive and/or negative in different situations, and that the context and the personal attitude of the opinion holder should be taken into consideration while determining the polarity of the phrase, instead of doing this out of a particular context.
